Two APIs, "Ticketmaster" and "Google Calender", are synchronized together. 

At the beginning, user is asked to provide a zip code, and then the Ticketmaster
API will generate all the events in that Zip Code, and provide them to the user.
When user is interested in any of the events provided, they can add that event to
their Google Calender with just one click.

The credential file is under auth, and the credentials are partially removed.

The sequence diagram is provided and also a screencast explainig all the code and 
api calls in detail.
